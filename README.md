# DemoBlaze Web Application Test Automation Framework

## **üìå Overview**
This project is an Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber (BDD) Test Automation Framework, designed to test the DemoBlaze web application. The framework utilizes Java, TestNG, and Maven for dependency management, build automation, and test execution. It follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for maintaining separation of concerns and improving maintainability.
## **üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation**
### **Prerequisites**
Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **Java 18** or later
- **Maven (for dependency management and build automation)**
- **Chrome Browser**
- **Chromedriver** (managed automatically via WebDriverManager)

### **Installing Maven** ###
If Maven is not already installed, you can download it from the Apache Maven website and follow the installation instructions.

### **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/RaikhelsonV/DemoBlazeWebAppTesting/tree/main

### **Create the Configuration File**
In order for the tests to work properly, you need to create a config.properties file in the src/test/resources/ directory. The base_url value in this file contains the URL for the DemoBlaze web application. This allows the tests to run against the target application, and the URL can be easily updated if you need to switch to another environment (such as a staging or development environment).
- Path: src/test/resources/config.properties
- base_url=https://www.demoblaze.com

### **Running the Tests:**
- To execute all tests: mvn test
- TestRunner: Executes all test scenarios defined in the TestRunner class.
- Specific Features: Run individual feature files (home.feature, login.feature, signup.feature) for focused testing.

### **After running tests, reports are generated at:**
- target/cucumber-reports/report.html
