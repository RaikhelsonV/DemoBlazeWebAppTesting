# Important Test Scenarios

1. **New user can sign up**: This scenario tests the registration functionality.
    - **Why**: Registering new users is essential for growing the site's customer base. If registration doesn't work, the site loses potential new users. Ensuring the registration process is successful is crucial for user acquisition.

2. **User logs in with valid credentials**: This scenario tests the login functionality.
    - **Why**: Logging in allows users to access their accounts and personalized features. If the login doesn't work, users cannot utilize all the site's functionalities. Although the site currently does not provide any information on purchased items, future development and enhancements will enable users to view more details about their purchases and order history.

3. **Check adding a product to the cart**: This scenario directly tests adding a product to the cart.
    - **Why**: This is a crucial step in the purchasing process. If products cannot be added to the cart, users cannot complete their purchase, rendering the site ineffective for its primary purpose.

4. **Check deleting a product from the cart**: This scenario directly tests removing a product from the cart.
    - **Why**: Users should be able to easily manage their purchases, including removing items they no longer wish to buy. This ensures the total price is updated correctly and maintains user satisfaction.

5. **Check the order placement process**: This scenario tests the entire checkout process, including filling out the order form and seeing the confirmation message.
    - **Why**: Completing a purchase is the ultimate goal for users on the site. It's important to ensure the order placement process works correctly, including data entry and purchase confirmation.
