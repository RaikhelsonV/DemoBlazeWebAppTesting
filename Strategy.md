# Automation Strategy for DemoBlaze – 3-Month Plan

## 1. Tool Selection
### Primary Tools:
- **Selenium & Cucumber**: Main tools for automation testing.
- **TestNG**: For:
    - Configuring test execution order using annotations like @BeforeClass, @AfterClass, etc.
    - Running Cucumber scenarios as TestNG tests for convenience.
    - Improving reporting and integration with other tools like ExtentReports.
- **GitHub Actions**: For setting up CI/CD, automatically running tests with each code change.

### Additional Tools:
- **JMeter**: For load testing and performance verification of APIs.
- **Listener**: For adding monitoring and enhancing reporting during test execution.
- **RestAssured**: For testing RESTful services in Java.
- **Database Integration**:
    - **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: For storing test data and ensuring consistent test environments.
    - **Hibernate**: For managing database interactions within tests.

## 2. Understanding the Environment and Requirements
### Documentation:
- **Study Project Documentation**: Thoroughly review project documentation and business requirements to understand the system's functionality and objectives.
- **API Documentation**: Review API documentation (if applicable) to understand endpoints, request/response formats, and integration points.

### Test Design:
- **Analyze Current Test Structure**: Evaluate the current test structure and test cases to ensure they align with requirements.
- **Identify Gaps**: Identify any gaps in the current test coverage and plan for additional tests to cover those areas.

### Manual Testing:
- **Perform Manual Testing**: Conduct manual testing to understand key usage scenarios and potential issues. Identify critical paths and user interactions that need to be automated.
- **Explore Edge Cases**: Test edge cases and boundary conditions manually to ensure comprehensive understanding.

### Collaboration:
- **Engage with Stakeholders**: Communicate with the test manager, project manager, developers, and business analysts to clarify requirements and gather insights.

## 3. Critical Test Implementation
### Month 1:
#### 1. Authorization and Registration (Critical)
- **Why priority?**: Authorization and registration are the initial steps for the user. If these processes fail, users won't be able to log in or register, leading to customer loss and revenue reduction.
- **Tests**:
    - Registration with unique data (successful and unsuccessful registration).
    - Login with correct and incorrect credentials.

#### 2. Process of Adding to Cart and Checkout (Critical)
- **Why priority?**: This process is directly related to business operations. Errors in adding items to the cart or completing the order can result in financial losses and poor user experience.
- **Tests**:
    - Add item to the cart and display in the list.
    - Remove items from the cart.
    - Checkout with correct data.
    - Check successful order confirmation generation with correct information.
    - Attempt checkout with incorrect data (e.g., invalid credit card number).
    - Attempt checkout with an empty cart.
    - Attempt checkout if the cart is overfilled.

#### 3. Correctness of Price Display and Product Information (High)
- **Why priority?**: Incorrect prices or product details can lead to legal consequences or financial losses. It also reduces user trust.
- **Tests**:
    - Check correct display of prices on product pages.
    - Verify the final price of items in the cart.

#### 4. Data Security Testing (Critical)
- **Why priority?**: Protecting user data and confidential information (e.g., payment data) is crucial. Data breaches or mishandling can lead to legal consequences and reputational damage.
- **Tests**:
    - Token generation during successful authentication.
    - Test secure password storage (check for hashing).
    - Masking payment information, such as credit card numbers.
    - After logout, user data should not be displayed, and the user should be completely logged out.

#### 5. Cross-Browser Support and Compatibility Testing (High)
- **Why priority?**: Ensure that the application works correctly on all major browsers.
- **Tests**:
    - Compatibility testing with browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) using Selenium.

### Month 2:
#### 6. API Functionality Testing (Critical)
- **Why priority?**: API is vital for server-client communication, and testing it ensures the system’s integrity.
- **Tests**:
    - API performance testing with JMeter: checking performance and load.
    - Data correctness and error handling via Postman.
    - Testing with Rest Assured:
        - Automate API tests for verifying responses (status codes, headers, response body).
        - Validate data in responses (compare with expected results).

### Month 3:
#### 7. Mobile Device Testing (High)
- **Why priority?**: As more users make purchases through mobile devices, it’s important to ensure the mobile version of the site functions correctly, or there will be high bounce rates and customer losses.
- **Tests**:
    - Test functionality on mobile devices (check that all UI elements are displayed and functional).
    - Test all key processes (registration, login, adding items to cart, and checkout) on mobile devices.

#### 8. Responsiveness Testing (Medium)
- **Why priority?**: With the increase of mobile users, it’s critical to ensure the app adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Tests**:
    - Test the interface's adaptability and responsiveness across various devices (mobile phones and tablets).

#### 9. System Performance and Stability Testing (Medium)
- **Why priority?**: It's essential to ensure the application handles peak loads and operates smoothly under high traffic.
- **Tests**:
    - Load testing with JMeter or other tools to test performance.
    - Stress testing to evaluate the system’s behavior under extreme conditions.

#### 10. Test Maintenance and Improvement (Ongoing)
- **Why priority?**: As new features or changes are introduced, tests need to be updated.
- **Tests**:
    - Continuous test updates, adding new scenarios as new features and bug fixes are implemented.

## 4. Expanding Coverage and Edge Cases
### 1. Automating all scenarios:
- Cover both valid and invalid scenarios (e.g., incorrect data during registration and login).
- Testing with edge values (e.g., large and small data, cart overflow).

### 2. Types of tests:
- **UI tests**: UI testing with Selenium across different browsers and devices.
- **API tests**: Using RestAssured for API testing (valid/invalid requests).
- **Load tests**: Using JMeter for performance testing under high load.

### 3. Covering all user paths:
- Automating all key user flows (registration, login, adding to cart, and checkout).
- Testing rare cases, such as attempting to checkout with an empty cart or an overfilled cart.

### 4. Test support:
- Cross-browser testing to ensure compatibility with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Listeners and logging to monitor test execution and enhance reporting.

### 5. Error handling:
- Testing proper error handling and system resilience to failures.
